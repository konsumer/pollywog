{"name":"Pollywog","body":"# teh pollywog saiz \"o hai!\"\r\n\r\n## Wot? Another framework? Sounds dumb.\r\n\r\nPollywog saves me time when I want a 1-page app, that loads quick, manages dependencies (even in minification,) has pre-made bindings for the data-layers I use most, keeps my code organized, and provides a view layer.  It's not MVC, but it's kind of similar, and it's not really doing all that much but adding a few little helpers. All the parts are optional, and you can leave out whatever you like (although without [RequireJS], [Open-ajax], the state_manager, the templating engine, and the data-helpers, there really isn't anything left.)\r\n\r\nInstall Pollywog on your webserver, and navigate to it's index.html for more info.\r\n","tagline":"A tiny framework for making client-side data-driven apps","google":"UA-30559348-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
